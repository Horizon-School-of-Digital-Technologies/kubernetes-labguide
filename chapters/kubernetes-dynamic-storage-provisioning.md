# Dynamic Storage Provisioning

This tutorial explains how kubernetes storage works and the complete workflow for the dynamic provisioning. The topics include

  * Storage Classes
  * PersistentVolumeClaim
  * persistentVolume
  * Provisioner

## Deploy Database with a Persistent Volume Claim

Lets use the [db deployment](https://github.com/Horizon-School-of-Digital-Technologies/k8s-code/blob/master/projects/instavote/dev/db-deploy.yaml), change the configuration by adding the persistentVolumeClaim info:

`file: db-deploy-pvc.yaml`

```
...
spec:
   containers:
   - image: postgres:9.4
     imagePullPolicy: Always
     name: db
     ports:
     - containerPort: 5432
       protocol: TCP
     #mount db-vol to postgres data path
     volumeMounts:
     - name: db-vol
       mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
   #create a volume with pvc
   volumes:
   - name: db-vol
     persistentVolumeClaim:
       claimName: db-pvc
```

Apply *db-deploy-pcv.yaml*  as

```
kubectl apply -f db-deploy-pvc.yaml
```

To monitor resources for this lab, open a new terminal and start watching for relevant objecting using the following command. 

```

watch kubectl get pods,pvc,pv,storageclasses 
```
We will call the terminal where you are running the above command as your **Monitoring Screen**. 

  * Observe and note if the pod for *db* is launched.
  * What state is it in ? why?
  * Has the persistentVolumeClaim been bound to a persistentVolume ? Why?


## Creating a Persistent Volume Claim

Create the following file with the specs below

`file: db-pvc.yaml`

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: db-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
  storageClassName: gp2

```

`if you are using your own cluster, make sure to use the right storage class.`

create the Persistent Volume Claim and validate

```
kubectl get pvc


kubectl apply -f db-pvc.yaml

kubectl get pvc,pv

```

  * Is persistentVolumeClaim created ?  Why ?
  * Is persistentVolume created ?  Why ?
  * Is the persistentVolumeClaim bound with a persistentVolume ?


### Validate

Now, observe the output of  the following commands,

```
kubectl get pvc,pv
kubectl get pods
```

  * Do you see pvc bound to pv ?
  * Do you see the pod for db running ?


## Nano Project [Optional Exercise]

Similar to postgres which mounts the data at /var/lib/postgresql/data and consumes it to store the database files, Redis creates and stores the file at **/data** path.  Your task is to have a gp2 ebs volume of size **1Gi** created and mounted at /data for the redis container.

You could follow these steps to complete this task

  * create a pvc by name **redis**
  * create a volume in the pod spec with type persistentVolumeClaim. Call is **redis-data**
  * add volumeMounts to the container spec (part of the same deployment file) running redis and have it mount **redis-data** volume created in the pod spec above.





#### Summary

In this lab, you not only setup dynamic provisioning using NFS, but also learnt about statefulsets as well as rbac policies applied to the nfs provisioner.
